# laraveldocs_chrome_extension (Laravel (V 5.8) | Offline docs)
Simple Chrome extension I made to view laravel docs(V 5.8) offline with breeze :_)
(Any collaboration is open :) fork it, play with it send a pull request ..

A image showing the working extension 
![extension demo](https://github.com/PrijalBista/laraveldocs_chrome_extension/blob/master/laravelDocsExtensionDemo.png "extension Demo")

I could not publish it in the webstore (initial payment of USD $ 5 required ) So feel free to publish it yourself
if you want if u have already made that payment and verified your account.

For those who Dont want to wait and install it unofficially :) Its very very simple Let me walk you through the process
1. Clone this repo (we will only need the contents of the extension directory )

      `git clone https://github.com/PrijalBista/laraveldocs_chrome_extension.git`

2. Open chrome and open extension management by typing the following in url
      
       chrome://extensions/
3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
4. Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.And Thats it!. Heres a visual guide after cloning.
![install extension guide](https://github.com/PrijalBista/laraveldocs_chrome_extension/blob/master/install_extension.gif "install extension guide")
5. DONE! :) now the laravel logo will appear in the extensions section (usually top right corner as in screenshot)

Enjoy using it. Get to docs faster :)

What, u can make it better? Great i am open to pull requests :).

Currently only V5.8 docs  is added and can be viewed :_ to cut out space. No other versions docs are accessible however u can add easily if u tinker with it.
